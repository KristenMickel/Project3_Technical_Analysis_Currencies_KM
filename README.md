## Description
My project builds a website called “Currency$Conversations”. It is intended to be a one-stop-shop for all things related to analysis, trading, and discussion of the currency markets. After signing-up or logging-in, the user can select which currency they want to pair with the USD, and then they will see a Candlestick Chart render for the base-pair of their currency with USD over the month of October 2022. In the future, I will not hard-code USD or the month of October. The user can then make a comment and others can comment back. In the future, I would like to add preservation of the chart in all relevant conversations, the ability to apply technical indicators to the chart, and the ability to make an actual trade.
